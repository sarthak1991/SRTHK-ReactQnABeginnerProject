This is a project for the React interview QnA - the beginner series made by [Sarthak Batra](www.srthk.com) for [Guvi](www.Guvi.in)

## Introduction to this activity and pre-requisites
1. For this activity and this course, we're assuming you have a basic understanding of Javascript, that is all, because, React essentially is a Javascript Library.  

2. This course does assume you have an installation of node. That is what is used to run the project. If not, you can go to [the NodeJs Website](www.nodejs.org) and grab the LTS release and then try the above steps again. 

## Set the project up

1. Clone the project on your local machine.

2. Once the project is cloned and set up, **navigate inside the project by typing ```cd SRTHK-ReactQnABeginnerProject```**

3. **Run the project** by typing ```yarn start```

  - This will open the project in a browser.
  - What I have done is I have hit an external api called *JsonPlaceholder* that provides dummy data. The API gives me an array response, which I've captured in a state variable and I am looping through that response in the browser, as you can see when you run the project

4. Open the project in your editor of choice. 

# Project Instructions

Now, here's the exercise for you. 

1. Make this display into an unordered list. 

2. If you open the console, you'll see an error. During this course, we have learnt why we have that error. Find a way to resolve that error so that we don't see it anymore. 

## Optional challange

### There are three optional exercises too, if you feel like attempting them. 

1. The first is an actual error, which, while technically correct as per javascript, will come back to haunt you as the project gets bigger or complex. Find it and fix it. *I'll give you a hint - it's how we declare state. *

2. Make the componentDidMount an arrow function.  

3. Convert componentDidMount into async/await. 

*You can attempt these optional exercises in any order as you see fit as they are independent of each other. Try it, it's not that hard really. Use the internet for help and remember, bugs will occur but researching internet for bugs and errors is probably the best skill you'll learn across the board as a computer engineer.*

- I'll post this project as a public project on my github account, the link to which you will find in the lesson description. Inside the project, you'll also find a soltuion.js.. If you just copy everything inside solution.js and replace it with everything inside app.js, you'll have the solution to both the problems. But before you do that, I implore you to try and solve these on your own. 

- And that's it from my side for right now. I'll see you in my next course. Good luck!
